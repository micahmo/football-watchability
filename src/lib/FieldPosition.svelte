   * jump, because the field is tall and the gaps are frequent, so everything below
   * moved each time the situation lapsed. And it hid markers whose data was right
   * there: on the first play of a drive ESPN publishes a yard line and a
   * "1st & 10 at BUF 38" while `down` is still -1 and possession is empty, and the
   * ball and the line of scrimmage need neither of those.
   *
   * What genuinely cannot be drawn without possession is anything with a direction:
   * the line to gain and the drive arrow. Possession is recoverable from
   * `lastPlay.team`, and deliberately not used, because the moment it goes missing
   * is the moment after a change of possession, when the team that ran the last
   * play is the team that just gave the ball away. On the kickoff that prompted
   * this, that would have pointed both of them at the wrong end zone.

   * "1st & 10 at BUF 38" above a blank space for want of a number it was not using
