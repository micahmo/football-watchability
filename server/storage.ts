 * Durable storage for the one feature that needs it.

 * the container is disposable. Push notifications are not: a VAPID keypair that
 * changes silently invalidates every subscription anyone has made, and the
 * subscriptions themselves cannot be rebuilt from anywhere.
 *
 * So the feature is offered only when there is somewhere real to put them. A
 * container cannot be told it has a volume, but it can look: a mounted volume is
 * a separate mount from the container's own layer, and the filesystem type says
 * whether it is real storage or RAM.
