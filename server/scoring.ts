 * two are 1.5-point lines, one of them a 1.5-point favorite losing 49-14, which
 * the old scoring rated a *maximal* upset because the margin was large. A toss-up
 * ending in a blowout is a blowout. The floor sits on a plateau rather than a
 * cliff: no game that fires the tag has a line between 1.5 and 13.5, so anything
