/**
 * Serves the built board against a fabricated slate, for capturing the README
 * screenshots.
 *
 * Screenshots need a busy live board, and a live board only exists while games
 * are being played. Waiting for a Sunday to photograph a UI change is not a
 * workflow, and the alternative of shipping stale images is worse: the pair in
 * docs/ went three features out of date before anyone noticed.
 *
 * The scores here are invented but everything around them is real. Teams,
 * records, lines and networks come from the live ESPN slate, and the ratings are
 * produced by importing the actual scoring model rather than being typed in, so
 * a screenshot cannot show a number the board would never produce.
 *
 *   npm run build
 *   node scripts/mock-board.mjs --mode live      # or: --mode upcoming
 *
 * Then open http://localhost:8799 and capture at a phone width.
